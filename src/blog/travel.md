# I love Travelling

<p>
I am from Nepal. A country full of beauty. Nepal is a blessed country with numerous mountains, lakes, rivers and forests.
</p>
<p>
We have 8 out of the 14 mountains above 8,000 meters in Nepal. Mount Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Annapurna, and Cho-Oyu are the eight mountains that are over 8,000 meters.
