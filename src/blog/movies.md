This is my absolute favourite series of all time. I can watch its clips anytime. The series is about, a simple guy, chemistry teacher goes how far to make up for his family before he dies as was diagnoised with cancer. Later, he just cannot stop after seeing what he is great at even if its cooking meths.

This movie is a heart-breaking, emotional and beautiful piece that I loved watching and do recommend to anyone.
A mentally challanged father was wrongfully imprisoned for a murder. Despite fighting the case against a man in power, the guy in the cell No. 7 builds friendship with a bunch of criminals with his innocence, and finally is able to get out of the sad mess.
